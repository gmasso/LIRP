\section{Introduction}




For any business, the stock is a major financial asset. 
Therefore, its volume must be controlled in order to avoid stock-out and minimize holding costs. 
The Vendor managed inventory (VMI) is based on the principle that the company selling a product has only a stock directly dedicated to the delivery to customers. In other words, all items received are placed on the shelf and stock replenishment is the responsibility of the supplier. VMI had motivated much research about the joint optimization of the inventory and transport, leading to the inventory routing problem (IRP). The IRP considers one supplier running a fleet of vehicles and a set of customers who consume a good on a multi-period time horizon. The objective of the IRP is to jointly optimize the delivery schedule of customers, the quantities delivered, and the delivery routes to be covered in each period, while minimizing the sum of routing costs and storage costs.

Traditional applications of the IRP have been listed in the survey \cite{Coelho2014}. They mainly concern the distribution of commodities, raw materials or fast moving consumer goods. These activities rely on a stable supply chain network. 
In industrial applications the set of customers is quite stable and the starting points of all defined for a long duration.
For example, distribution of fuel always starts from the same fuel depots, which capacity and location cannot be easily modified. 

In this paper we consider an extension of the IRP concerning emerging activities which supply chain is not yet designed, 
or any activity has to frequently revise its supply chain design, e.g. delivery of e-commerce goods or services to a set of customers that changes over time. We assume a three-level supply chain consisting of one production facility, several intermediate depot called distribution centers (DC) and a larger set of customers. A single product is first carried from the production facility to DCs, and then from DCs to customers. The decision variables concern the location of DCs, the allocation of customers to DC and all IRP decisions previously cited. 
This optimization problem is called the Location Inventory Routing Problem (LIRP). This problem appeared recently in the scientific literature \cite{AhmadiJavid2010} and has been more and more studied since then. 





\subsubsection*{Generalites sur les problèmes combines}

The LIRP combines three families of well-known optimization problems: vehicle routing, facility location and inventory management. 
The pairwise combination these problems gave rise to the Location Routing Problem (LRP), the Inventory Routing Problem (IRP) and the Inventory Location Problem (ILP). These three integrated problems have already been the subject of many publications in recent decades.
The inventory problem has been studied for more than 30 years \cite{Coelho2014}. Prior surveys had been published by \cite{Campbell98}, \cite{MoinSalhi2007}. Interested reader may also read the tutorial by \cite{Bertazzi2012}. 
Very few models consider the inventory routing problem within a two-echelon or multi-echelon network	\cite{GuimaraesCoelho2019}
Location Routing problems have been studeid for several decades. Recent surveys include \cite{ProdhonPrins2014}, \cite{DrexlSchneider2015} and \cite{Schneider2017}.  
As pointed by \cite{Melo2009}, facility location is frequently combined with inventory decisions. 
The problem is to determine the optimal number of distribution centers,  their locations,  the retailers assigned to each distribution center,  and the optimal ordering policy at the distribution centers.  Reviews on inventory location problems have been proposed by \cite{kaviani_location-inventory_2009} 
and \cite{farahani_location-inventory_2015}. 
	
The outline of this paper are the following. 
In section \ref{sec:lit}, we review the scientific literature dedicated to the LIRP. 
In section \ref{sec:model}, we propose a new mathematical formulation of the LIRP and show that this formulation is general enough to 
cover several types of supply chain networks. 
In section \ref{sec:algo}, we propose a Route Sampling Heuristic (RSH) algorithm for the LIRP. 
In section \ref{sec:expe}, we introduce new LIRP instances and report numerical experiments that show the performance of our algorithm.


\section{Review of the literature} \label{sec:lit}

The location inventory routing problem LIRP has been attracting much research effort in the very recent years, but preliminary works have appeared several decades ago.  
In this section, we review the main publications related to the LIRP.
Section \ref{sec:almost} summarizes the preliminary works that led to a formal definition of the LIRP. 
Next sections described the modeling of the main LIRP components: location and supply chain design (section \ref{sec:l}), 
routing (\ref{sec:r} and inventory policies (\ref{sec:i}). 

\subsection{Preliminary works related to the LIRP}
\label{sec:almost}

 The idea of integrating location, inventory and routing decisions in mathematical models is not new, but most models have been considered intractable until the recent progress of mathematical programming solvers and heuristic solution methods. 
In 1988, \cite{PerSir88} pointed the necessary interdependence between location, inventory and routing decisions. 
The authors proposed an integrated model combining location and inventory decisions, but only direct shipments were considered and no computational experiments were presented. 
This model has been extended by \cite{AmbScu05} to a multi-level problem with distribution routes visiting several customers. The authors also propose a dynamic models (with multiple periods). Computational experiments show the practical difficulty of solving static models (with one time period). 


Several LIRP related papers considered the three main decisions in a hierarchical way, or priority is given to one or two decisions. 
In \cite{LiuLee03} and \cite{LiuLin05}, inventory management decisions are taken independently from routing and location. 
\cite{Shen07} explicitly model facility location and allocation decisions but use approximated routing costs instead of formal routing costs. 
\cite{MetZab10} propose a two-stage stochastic programming approach for a medical supply
storage and distribution problem.
At the first stage, storage locations and the optimal inventory policy are determined. 
At the second stage, a recourse routing plan is optimized for each disaster scenario. 
Routing decision are decoupled from location and inventory decisions. 
Hence, all these references cannot be \textit{stricto sensu} considered as LIRP models. 

\subsection{Supply chain design}
\label{sec:l} 

As an integrated optimization problem, the LIRP usually arises in complex logistics networks with several level of facilities. 
Depending on the volume of the shipments, transport can be organized in full truckload (FTL) or less than truckload (LTL) legs. 
In FTL transport, shipments are sent directly from their origin to their destination. In LTL transport, routes have one origin and several delivery points. The roads are therefore multi-clients. The presence of a ``routing'' component in the LIRP assumes the existence of routes visiting multiple sites, at least in one part of the supply chain.
The vast majority of LIRP articles deal with three-level networks such as that illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:directloop}. 
Direct routes are performed between a production facility (large red circle) delivers a set of depots or distribution centers (small red circles). A second echelon includes routes visiting several end customers (blue circles).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\inputfig{model1}
	\caption{LIRP model with direct+route supply chain design}
		\label{fig:directloop}
	\end{figure}

Several papers deviate from this main scheme.  \cite{Zhang2014} consider only 2 levels: a set of candidate depots and customers. Routes start at a depot and visit several customers ; no inventory decision is made at depots. 

\cite{AmbScu05} and \cite{Tavana2018} extend the main logistics scheme to a 4 level network. Shipments are direct in the upper echelon whereas LTL routes are performed in the two lower echelons. 
\cite{Eskandari2018} study a blood supply chain with 4 level. They consider direct shipment between the first three levels and multi-point routes for the final delivery. 
\cite{Bashiri2018} consider a network with multi-point routes at the first echelon and direct deliveries at the second echelon. 
Finally, \cite{Riquelme2016} introduce the location arc routing problem with inventory constraints. 

Moreover, only a few papers (\cite{LiuChenLiLiu2015}, \cite{Deng2016}, \cite{Zhalechian2016} and \cite{LiGuoWangFu2013} 
consider a closed-loop supply chain. 


\subsection{Route formulation}
\label{sec:r}

A large majority of the LIRP mathematical models uses an arc-based representation of the routes. 
However, in many applications, the number of customer visited within a route is limited by a number of practical constraints (time constraints, stopover costs, detour constraints). \cite{MaDav05} propose a distribution chain design  minimizing location fixed costs, inventory costs and transportation costs. They observe that vehicles can only serve one site in their journey, and thus, do not model a full LIRP model. 

\cite{Guerrero2013} propose a route-based model with an exponential number of routes. A relaxation of the model is decomposed into an inventory location problem and a routing problem which is solved by column generation. 
The model in \cite{Lehrlaly2016} is based on all feasible routes with no more than three customers. 
Route based models are also used in \cite{LiGuoWangFu2013}, \cite{LiuChenLiLiu2015},  \cite{Deng2016} and \cite{hiassat_genetic_2017} 
but these papers do not detail routes generation.

\subsection{Inventory policies}
\label{sec:i}

As far as inventory management is concerned, the literature can be classified in two main families: 
some papers consider a continuous time inventory policy whereas others consider discretized time periods. 
In the first case, demand is considered either constant (see e.g. \cite{AhmSed2012}, \cite{Deng2016})
or subject to a known distribution such as the normal distribution (see e.g. \cite{Zhalechian2016}, \cite{Saragih2018}) or 
the Poisson distribution (see e.g. \cite{Asadi2018}, \cite{HabibiAS2018}). 
Classical continuous review policies such as $(r,Q)$ and $(S-1,S)$ policies are applied and the same inventory cycle repeats over time. 
Note that in this category, the objective function often incorporates the average value of inventory or their standard deviation. 
These values yield non linearity. 
Thus, only small instances can be solved by MINLP solvers, or general purpose heuristics and metaheuristics are used. 

Table \ref{tab1} present a synthesis of the main bibliographic references concerning the LIRP with continuous time inventory policy.

Note that all references cited in Table \ref{tab1} consider logistics network with three layers. 
Direct shipments are performed from layer 1 to layer 2 and routes between a facility at layer 2 and several client at layer 3. 


The model considered in thiss paper considers discretized time periods me periods and all demands and flow values within one period are aggregated. This leads to inventory management policies that look like lot-sizing policies. Most references study models in which all data including demand are variable but deterministic (see e.g. \cite{Guerrero2013}, \cite{Zhang2014}, \cite{Ghorbani2016}). 
\cite{Vahdani2018} consider stochastic storage capacity. 
\cite{Rayat2017} explicitly model stochastic demand and propose an MINLP bi-objective model with multiple periods and multiple products. The model is solved with an epsilon constraint and several multi-objective metaheuristics. 
Uncertainty can also be incorporated through various modeling techniques.

\subsection{Contribution of this paper}

This paper brings contribution in the LIRP literature in three ways. 
First, we propose new route-based mathematical model for a multi-level logistics network with both FTL and LTL routes. 
Without loss of generality we describe a network with one production facility, multiple levels of candidate distribution centers 
and a larger set of customers at the last level. 
Second, we propose a sampling solution method based on the decomposition of large instances in several smaller instances that are tractable by an MILP solver. 
Finally, we introduce new instances for the LIRP and present computational experiments that show the relevance of our approach. 

\section{Mathematical model}

\label{sec:model}

\subsection{Problem settings and notations}\label{subsection:settings}

\OP{Choix de vocabulaire: comment appelle t-on un site ? Facility , location, facility location?}

We consider a  distribution network composed of one production facility, 
a set of customers and a set intermediate logistics facilities called distribution centers (DC). 
The list of customers as well as their demand are assumed deterministic on a given time horizon $T$, typically a few weeks. 
The set of customers is denoted by $\cu$ and the demand of customer $i \in \cu$ at time period $t\in T$ is denoted by $d^t_i$.

We propose a unified model that covers a broad spectrum of potential applications and distribution networks. 
In particular, the model includes the possibility of dealing with multiple levels of DCs and material flows with both FLT and LTL distribution (see, e.g. \cite{AmbScu05}). 

Let us call $\loc$ the set of all facility locations (DCs and customers) in the distribution network. 
We assume that $\loc$ is decomposed into levels and we denote by $\loc_k$ the set of facility locations at level $k$. 
A depot lies on level 1 if it is delivered by the production facility only. 
It lies at level $k$ if it is delivered by at least one DC from level $k-1$. 
Let $L$ be the number of levels in the networks. By definition, the set $\cu$ of customers corresponds to $\loc_L$.
Moreover, $\loc=\cup_{k=1}^L \loc_k$.
%
Selecting a DC incurs a fixed opening cost $f_j$ for each DC. 
This cost is paid once at the beginning of the planning horizon. 
Note that the choice of selected DCs cannot be modified during the whole period. 
%
Temporary storage of goods at DCs and customers is authorized. 
Delivering these facilities in advance is not penalized but incurs a holding cost $h^t_i$ for every good stored at facility $i \in \loc$ at period $t \in T$.
The initial inventory at facility $i \in \loc$ is denoted by $I_i^0$. 
We assume that inventory level at facility $i \in \loc$ cannot excess maximal value $I_i^{\max}$. 

Our model is based on a set of existing routes in the logistics network. 
This set $\ro$ is potentially large but enumerable. 
Similarly to the set of facilities, the set of routes can be decomposed in levels: $\ro = \cup_{k=1}^{L} \ro_k$. 
All routes $r \in \ro_k$ start from a facility (production facility or DC) at level $k-1$ and deliver facilities at level $k$. 
For each route $r \in \ro$, the list of facilities visited is given by an indicator vector. 
For the sake of clarity, we define two indicators: 
$\beta_{jr}$ is equal to 1 if $r$ starts from DC $j \in \loc \setminus C$, and 0 otherwise;
$\alpha_{ir}$ is equal to 1 if route $r \in \ro_{L}$ visits facility $i \in \loc$, and 0 otherwise.

Each route 	$r\in \ro$ has a cost $c_r$ that consists of a (possibly zero) fixed ordering cost along with a stopover cost at each facility visited and a routing cost roughly proportional to the route length. Note that route costs are deterministic and do not depend on the load carried. 
Finally, each route level is operated by a homogeneous fleet of vehicle. 
Let $\nu_k$ the number of vehicles available at level $k$ and $\kappa_k$ their capacity.

\subsection{Mathematical  formulation}\label{subsection:MIP}

In this section, we present our mixed integer linear formulation for the LIRP. 
The objective function to be minimized can be stated as follows: 
 
\begin{equation} \label{objfunct}
    \text{minimize} \sum_{j\in \loc \setminus \cu} f_{j} y_{j} +\sum_{t\in T} \left( \sum_{r\in \ro} c_r z_{rt} + \sum_{i\in \loc} h_{it} I_{it}\right)
    \end{equation} 
    
    The first term in equation \ref{objfunct} represents the sum of fixed opening costs for all DCs selected. 
    The second term is the sum of all routing costs and inventory costs during the time horizon considered. 
    
  The LIRP is subject to the following constraints:
    
    \begin{alignat}{3}
&&\sum_{r\in \ro_L} \alpha_{ir} z_{rt} &\leq 1 						&\forall i&\in \cu, t \in T  					\label{const:singleroutecustomers}\\

&&I_{it} 	&\leq \min\left(I_i^{\max}, \sum_{t' > t}d_{it'}\right)	&\forall i&\in \cu,  t \in T					\label{const:invcustUB}\\
&&q_{irt}			&\geq 0 										&\forall k&=1,\ldots,L,  i\in \loc_k,  r\in \ro_k,\forall t \in T	\label{const:upos}	\\
&&I_{it}			&\geq 0 										&\forall i &\in \loc,  t \in T					\label{const:invCpos}	\\
&&y_{j}				& \in \{0,1\} 								&\forall j&\in \loc\setminus\cu						\label{const:ybool}\\	
&&z_{rt}			&\in \{0,1\} 									&\forall r&\in \ro,  t \in T					\label{const:zbool}
\end{alignat}


Single delivery constraints~\eqref{const:singleroutecustomers} state that, at any period, the whole demand of customers is delivered by at most one route. 
%
Constraints ~\eqref{const:singleroutedc} express the same idea for DCs: at any period, the whole demand of a DC is served by at most one route serving the corresponding level. Moreover, this constraint prevents from delivering non selected DCs. 
%
Constraint~\eqref{const:startfromopendepots} ensures that routes start only from selected depots. 
%

\subsection{Targeted use cases}

The MIP formulation presented in section \ref{subsection:MIP} models a general version of the LIRP, 
that allows many supply chain networks and routing policies. 
In this paper, we specifically address the case of a distribution network with one production facility and two tiers of facilities in the distribution network ($L=2$): one set ($\loc_1$) of DCs and one set $\cu=\loc_2$ of clients. 
Moreover, routes are concentrated in one single echelon whereas only direct shipments are performed at the second echelon. 
Under these assumptions, we consider two particular cases:

 Figure~\ref{fig:dl} illustrates the ``Direct+Loop'' network, in which the set $\ro_1$ consists of direct shipments from the production center to DCs
 and the set $\ro_2$ consists of routes starting at a DC and visiting one or several clients.  This type of network is commonly used by two-level distribution systems that deliver DCs with full truckloads and individual clients by routes starting at a DC.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:ld} illustrates the ``Loop+Direct'' network, in which the set $\ro_1$  consists of routes starting at the production center and visiting one one several DCs, and the set $\ro_2$ consists of direct shipments from DCs to clients. This type of network may concern all distribution networks in which clients collect goods at the distribution center or a locker.

In this paper we present the case of a distribution network. Without loss of generality, our model can be applied to the collection of goods from multiples origins to a set of collection centers and one single processing center.

\section{Matheuristic method} 
\label{sec:algo}

The LIRP  results from the integration of several classical NP-hard optimization problems. 
Hence it is doubtful that any solver could produce optimal solutions directly from the above formulation in reasonable time, except for very small instances. The computational complexity of the problem is strongly influenced by the number of routes considered.
A great number of routes implies that there are several ways to serve each location, which in turns makes the inventory problem more difficult.
Finally, one may observe that in a simple network with two levels, one DC and $n$ clients, even restricting the problem to routes with at most $m$ stops, the number of admissible routes is $\mathcal{O}(n^m)$.

To overcome this complexity issue, we propose a two-stage heuristic method to obtain good solutions within acceptable time.
The heuristic relies on the assumption that an MILP solver is able to find optimal or non-optimal good solutions for small instances of the LIRP. 
Thus, the main idea of our heuristic is (i) to split the original MILP into several subproblems for which it is possible to compute (near) optimal solutions independently and (ii) to collect the routes contained in these (near) optimal solutions to form a restricted pool of elite routes. 
By doing this, we expect than the MILP solver will be able to solve one elite instance made of routes of the elite pool only. 
Hence, the main challenge of our algorithm is to find a good partition of the original problem into smaller subproblems and to progressively shrink the set of routes available to the model. 


We propose a Route Sampling Heuristic (RSH) which simplified scheme is described in Figure \ref{fig:algo1}. 

The algorithm starts with the full set of routes, which is randomly shuffled, and then partitioned into independent subsets of routes of identical size. Each subset is solved independently with an MILP solver (we used IBM Cplex 12.8). All routes contained in the solutions returned by the solved are stored in a pool of so-called elite routes. 
Finally, we hope that the pool of elite routes will be tractable by an MILP solver.

\subsection{Refinements of the algorithm} 

Figure \ref{fig:algo1} presents an idealistic situation in which 
(i) each set $R_i, i \in 1\dots, \alpha$ yields a feasible instances that can be solved to optimality in reasonable computing time
(ii) the pool of elite routes also yields a feasible instance which is also tractable with an MILP solver. 

This is not always the case in practice. In this section, we explain how to improve the algorithm in order to avoid infeasibility and manage the size of subsets $R_i$ as well as the elite pool. 


Algorithm \ref{mainalgo} gives a more detailed description of our approach. 


In lines 12-16, sets $R_1$--$R_\alpha$ can be repeatedly used to yield elite routes. If $I_{max}=1$ the situation is like that presented by Figure \ref{fig:algo1}. Otherwise, the routes belonging to the solutions found by the MILP solver are removed from subsets $R_1 -- R_\alpha $ are the MILP solver is called again from this restricted set. This procedure can be used to extend the number of elite routes.

\subsection{Location based sampling}


\subsubsection{Model associated with one DC}

In the next section, we shall present several decompositions to reduce the number of routes considered by the model. 
One of these natural decompositions relies on a ``DC based'' splitting of the problem. 
Namely, this decomposition considers one subproblem $P_{\lambda}$ for each potential DC location $\lambda\in \loc_1$.
$P_{\lambda}$ is a subproblem of the original LIRP where the set of routes considered is $\ro(\lambda)= \ro_1(\lambda) \cup \ro_2(\lambda)$, where $\ro_1(\lambda)=\left\{r\in\ro_1:\beta_{\lambda}r=1 \mbox{ and } \alpha_{jr}=0\ \forall j\neq \lambda\right\}$ is the unique direct route from the supplier to DC $\lambda$ and $\ro_2(\lambda)=\left\{r\in\ro_2: \beta_{\lambda r}=1\right\}$ is the set of routes starting from DC $\lambda$.
The set of clients is restricted to $\cu(\lambda) =\{i\in\cu: \sum_{r\in\ro_2(\lambda)} \alpha_{ir}\geq 1 \}$, i.e. clients that can be served using a route that starts from DC $\lambda$ . 
Hence problem $P_{\lambda}$ is an inventory routing problem derived from the original LIRP, in which the location considerations have been discarded, as well as the routing from the supplier to DC $\lambda$. 
All the variables of the original MIP remain the same, except $q_{\lambda t}$ that represent the quantity delivered by the external supplier to DC $\lambda$ in period $t$.
The following MIP is a valid formulation of $P_{\lambda}$:
\begin{alignat}{3}
	\text{minimize} &&\sum_{t=1}^{T} \left( \sum_{r\in \ro(\lambda)} c_r z_{rt} + \sum_{i\in \left\{\lambda\right\}\cup \cu(\lambda)} h_{it} I_{it}\right)\span\omit\span\label{decomp_objfunct}\\

	&&z_{rt}					&\in \{0,1\} 														&\forall r&\in \ro_2(\lambda), \forall t\in T\label{const:decomp_zbool}
\end{alignat}


Sampling is performed in two steps.
First, the clients are pre-assigned to a number of DCs, as described in Algorithm \ref{algo:pre-allocation}.
Then, this pre-assignment is used to build location-based subsets of routes, as described in Algorithm \ref{algo:location-sampling}.

\subsubsection{Pre-allocation of clients to depots}

One important issue in supply chain network design is the allocation of customer to DCs. 
Constraint ~\eqref{const:singleroutecustomers} states that customers are delivered by at most one route everyday. However, we don't consider single-sourcing constraints. Thus, customer can be allocated to multiple DCs. 

Algorithm \ref{algo:pre-allocation} is used to pre-allocate clients to a subset of DCs (at least one in order to ensure feasibility). 
This pre-allocation step returns a $|C| \times |D|$ matrix that defines a list of possible allocations for each client. 
This matrix will be later modified in Algorithm \ref{algo:location-sampling} when open DCs are selected. 

First, each client is pre-allocated to its closest depot (line 4). 
Then, each client is allocated to its $N_{close}$ nearest depots provided the distance between the client and the depot is not larger than a value $\mu_1$ (line 5-8).

Finally, lines 11--22 implement a pre-allocation rule that is specific to clusters of clients. 
As represented in Figure \ref{fig:prealloc}, 
if two clients $c$ and $c'$ are distant of no more than a value $\mu_2$, and there exists a DC $d'$ such that
$c'$ is pre-allocated to $d'$ and $dist(d',c') + dist(c',c) + dist(c,d') < \mu_3$, then $c$ is also pre-allocated to $d'$.

\subsubsection{Heuristic selection of depots}

Algorithm \ref{algo:location-sampling} describes the selection of depots based on the pre-allocation of clients to depots defined by Algorithm \ref{algo:pre-allocation}. 

\begin{algorithm}
	\caption{Heuristic selection of depots}
	\label{algo:location-sampling}
	%\scriptsize
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
		\REQUIRE $D$: set of depots, $C$: set of clients, $A$: pre-allocation matrix, $p$: number of depots to be selected, $\beta$: parameter strictly greater than 1.
		\STATE  $A' \leftarrow$  $|C| \times |D|$ allocation matrix filled with zeros
		\STATE $S \leftarrow \emptyset$: list of selected depots
		\STATE $n \leftarrow 0$: number of clients assigned to some depot
		\WHILE {$|S| < p$ and $n < |C|$ } 
			\STATE $ D \leftarrow D \backslash S$
			\STATE Rank the set of depots $D$ by non-increasing order of the number of clients assigned to each depot
			\STATE Choose a random number $y$ in interval $[0,1)$]
			\STATE $d \leftarrow$ depot at position $\lceil y^\beta \; |D| \; \rceil$ in $D$.
			\FOR {all clients $c \in C$}
				\IF {$A[c][d] =1$}
					\STATE $A'[c][d] = 1$
					\STATE $n \leftarrow n+1$
					\FOR {all depots $d' \neq d$}
						\STATE $A[c][d'] = 0$ 
					\ENDFOR
				\ENDIF		
			\ENDFOR
		\ENDWHILE
		\IF {$n < |C|$}
			\STATE Add a dummy depot $\delta$
			\FOR {all $c\in C$ such that $\sum\limits_{d \in D} A[c][d] >0$}
				\STATE $A'[c][\delta]=1$
			\ENDFOR
		\ENDIF
		\RETURN $S$ and $A'$
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

All non selected depots are ranked by non-increasing number of clients pre-allocated to them (line 6).
Then, a depot randomly is selected using a biased roulette wheel selection mechanism giving a much higher probability to the first depots (lines 7--8). 
Since Algorithm \ref{algo:location-sampling} is called repeatedly in Algorithm \ref{mainalgo}, this randomized selection favours diversification. 

After selecting a depot, all clients that were pre-allocated to this depot are now allocated to it (lines 10--11) 
and their pre-allocation to all other depots is cancelled (line 14). 
The final loop (lines 19--24) is used to allocate remaining clients to a dummy depot. 

\textcolor{red}{Olivier: Là je ne suis plus très sûr. Pourquoi est-ce important d'allouer les clients restant à un dépot ? Que fait-on si on n'a pas sélectionné $p$ dépots ? Et d'ailleurs comment la valeur de $p$ est elle choisie ? }

\textcolor{red}{Olivier: Question: can we have a selected DC with no customer allocated to it? If yes, remove these DCs}


\newpage

\subsection{Filtering SD routes after depot selection}

After selecting a subset of DCs and allocating clients to selected DCs, routes must be filtered in order to remove useless ones. 
In the first $L-1$ levels, all routes that contain at least one unselected DC are removed from the route set. 
In the last level, routes that start at unselected DCs are removed from the route set, as well as routes visiting clients that are not allocating to the starting DC.

\section{Numerical experiments}
\label{sec:expe}
\subsection{Generation of instances}
\paragraph{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each route has a maximum duration, including the stops and the travel durations
    \item The cost of transportation is proportional to the duration of the route
    \item The speed of the vehicles is equal to 45 $\text{km}\cdot\text{h}^{-1}$
    \item The capacity of the vehicles is fixed
    \item Demand vary from one period to the next and from one client to another, as {\em high}, {\em low} or {\em mixed}
    \end{itemize}
\paragraph{Methodology}
We obtain different instances of LIRP by positioning the different locations involved on a shared map, combining different {\em layers}, where each layer contains specific elements of the final problem.
carrying some of the elements of the final problem.
E
Specifically, we use the following procedure to build and combine the different layers:
\begin{description}
    \item[Urban areas] We start by positioning
    \item[Clients]
    \item[DCs]
    \item[Demand boxes]
\end{description}


\subsection{Constraints}

 \cite{Zheng2019} restrict the number of variables by incorporating real-life constraints that are not part of their mathematical model: 
 vehicles can visit at most four retailers at one trip due to vehicle capacity limitation, and DCs can only serve retailers within a given radius. 
 These constraints help reduce the number of variables from 3 millions to 600 thousands.
 
 
 Why we consider routes at one echelon only? 
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item Distribution networks with multiple layer of routes: this requires combining routes obtained at each echelon. High combinatorial burden. 
	\item LIPR = hard problem. Probably not tractable with two many echelons. 
 \end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}



\subsection*{Possible extensions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Load dependent route cost. 
	\item Generalisation to extended networks
	\item One warehouse multi retailer routing problem
	\item combination of collection and delivery activities
	
\end{itemize}
